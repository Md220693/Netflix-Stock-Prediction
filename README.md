### Netflix-Stock-Prediction

# Project overview
This project focuses on predicting Netflix stock prices using historical data. The dataset includes daily stock prices from February 2018 to November 2021. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves visualizing trends in opening, closing, high, and low prices over the period. Notably, the project highlights the top five dates with the highest and lowest stock prices. Additionally, the analysis encompasses creating visualizations to illustrate the variation in high and low stock values over time.

# Dashboard Creation:
In addition to the analysis, I have created an interactive dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore the Netflix stock data visually, allowing for deeper insights and analysis.

# Data Source
The dataset used for the analysis purpose is taken from the kaggle website.
